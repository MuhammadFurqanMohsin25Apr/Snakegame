# Snakegame

I've created a classic Snake game using Python! In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The challenge is to avoid running into the walls or yourself as you navigate. I used the Pygame library to handle the graphics and controls, and I had a lot of fun coding it. It's a simple but addictive game that brings back some great memories of playing Snake on old mobile phones. Give it a try and see how long you can make your snake grow!
